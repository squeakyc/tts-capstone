			<p>Hi!  I'm Candice and I was born in Raleigh, NC. After graduating from NC State University with a degree in Horticultural Science, I worked at several super exciting places including:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Riverbanks Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden</strong> in Columbia, SC
				<li><strong>Atlanta Botanical Garden</strong> in Atlanta, GA
				<li><strong>Plant Delights Nursery</strong> in Raleigh, NC
			</ol>

			<img src="img/abg.jpg" width="55%"" alt="Atlanta Botanical Garden"></li>
			<p>However, there is little money to be made as a horticulturist!  So, in need of a better income, I took a job as the first office manager for a Wellness Facility in Garner, NC, where a little seed was planted in my head.  My new employer was in need of a brand new website, so I googled my way to Wix and designed one myself.</p>
			<p><img src="img/bw1.png" width="10%" alt="Body Wellness Homepage">Upon seeing my web design (<a href="https://www.bodywellnessnc.com/"><strong>Body Wellness Massage Therapy</strong></a>) come to life, that little seed grew into a desire to learn more about Web Design!</p>
